Hi folks! My name is **Antonio Muñoz**. I'm from Murcia, Spain.

I can visualize my hole life through names of videogames. I think the best way to know me better is to take a journey through all those games that are part of who I am. Let's learn videogame history!

All started at my grandfather's electronic shop. He was selling fridges, stereos, washing machines and so on. One day a strange black box appeared in the shop, its was the SEGA Master System with **Alex Kidd**. Why was I being able to move the character in the TV? My mind literally exploded that day. Alex Kidd was made in 1987, the same year I was born.

Not much later I started playing floppy disc games in MS-DOS on my father's computer. I still remember **Commander Keen** and **Duke Nukem**, such master pieces.

Soon came **Sonic** the hedgehog, my chilhood favourite game. Since Sonic I have a special attachment to platform games genre. I became a SEGA fan.

Then, my uncle started to bring computer games. **Wolfenstein 3D**. I was amazed seeing a 3D world, it felt so realistic! Then **DOOM**. Omfg what was that!! All those monsters, the effects, everything was impresive.

It's mandatory for me to talk about **Quake**. I still remember launching the LAN cable into the air through the window to play coop with my cousin that was living next to me.

Then **Age of Empires** was installed at my uncle's computer. At that time I had only played games where I controlled a single unit so I was pretty socked moving an entire army! Mining resources, building defenses, researching upgrades..such depth!

After that I ended up with a demo copy of **Starcraft**, just a couple of campaign missions, but I falled in love of that speed of gameplay. BEST RTS game ever made! I continue playing competitive **Starcraft 2** nowdays in case you want to play ^^.

A cybercafé opened in my town and I played **Half life** for the first time there. Half life felt different from minute one thanks to it's narrative. It wasn't just killing enemies, it had an intriguing story behind it. My favourite FPS no doubt.

Years later I was deciding about my university career. I wanted to make videogames so I decided to study *Computer Science*. I met a lot of my closest friends there, it was awesome to study with people with the same interests and hobbies.

I started working as web developer, I knew I would like it because I did some money developing web pages with Flash and PHP when I was younger. I have spent approximately six years developing web servers with Java as well as SQL data bases for public administration. But I always had videogames development in the back of my mind. I saved money along those years waiting the moment to change, it came late but it finally came.

Now? I'm currently living in Madrid. I have attended a videogame programming master's degree at *Complutense University* and I'm looking for a job as game programmer. It's time to contribute to videogame industry, put my skills at its service and make other people feel the same way I have felt. 

I had so much to tell that I ended up writing a full *About me* extended in my Gnome guts blog. [If you want to read more check it out here!]({{< ref "posts/about-me-extended.md" >}})

I hope you enjoyed the reading! :D
