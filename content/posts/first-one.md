Hi everybody! I’m Antonio Mu/oz from Murcia, Spain. I’m working on a video game called **NECROGNOMICON**. 

Necrognomicon it's an action-tower defense game, similar to Orcs Must Die, based in the village of Gnomeville where you have to defend critical houses from evil garden gnomes, with different traps and weapons that you can find by exploring the town. Check out our [itch.io page](https://ventekgames.itch.io/necrognomicon) and BE CAREFUL, gnomes are waking up.

**VENTEK GAMES** is a multidisciplinary team made up of talented people like artists, designers, programmers, producers, musicians and much more. 

This is the first of a series of blog posts where I will share information about the game and gut the most interesting parts of the development process from a programmer perspective. I will also post other kind of content if I feel is interesting.


Welcome to **Gnome guts**!
